# Modern Insights from Microscopy Images
> An Introduction to Web-based Methodologies


Technological evolution poises modern, web-based methods as the future of bioimage
analysis. Moreover, web-based methods are better suited to solve challenges such as
extremely large images and reproducibility. In this tutorial, we will introduce the concepts,
approaches, and tools for modern, web-based open source bioimage analysis. An introduction
to the fundamentals of web-based imaging is covered through the topics of web-based image
visualization, image data storage for the web, distributed image processing in the cloud,
asynchronous programming, and re-usable deep learning components on the web. Content will
be presented in Jupyter notebook modules consisting of oral presentations, interactive material,
and hands-on exercises.
